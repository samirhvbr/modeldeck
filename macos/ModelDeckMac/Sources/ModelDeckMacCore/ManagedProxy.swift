// Issue #421 — 1.0 build C: the Swift shell owns the bundled CLIProxyAPI's
// lifecycle (#397): start, stop, restart-on-crash, health surfaced in the
// deck. Management touches CONFIG + PROCESS only — never auth files (#398),
// which CLIProxyAPI remains the sole writer of. State lives at
// ~/.config/cliproxyapi, the SAME directory an external instance uses, so an
// existing install is adoptable without any credential migration.
//
// Everything side-effectful lives behind the protocols below so the state
// machine is fully unit-testable and tests NEVER spawn a proxy, touch port
// 8317, or read a real auth file.
//
// The safety rail (#400 double-consume): a managed instance is NEVER started
// while an EXTERNAL proxy answers on the port. Slice C refuses loudly and
// reports honestly — no offers, no consent screens, and it never stops a
// process the user started. The adoption UX is slice D (#422).
