// Issue #422 — 1.0 build D: the FIRST-LAUNCH surface for the managed proxy.
// One surface, two branches, per the #401 verdict and the onboarding addendum
// in docs/full-app-1.0-decision-map.md (2026-08-14):
//
//   1. An external CLIProxyAPI already answers on :8317 → offer ADOPTION.
//      Adopting stops the user's own job VISIBLY, names what it stopped and
//      how, and takes over the SAME config dir (#398 makes that
//      credential-migration-free). Declining = coexist: ModelDeck stays a
//      client of their instance and says WHY managed-only features are off.
//   2. Nothing answering → ONE consent screen, Enable pre-selected (tier-3
//      default, charter d4). Declining lands on tiers 1–2 and the upgrade
//      stays visible in Settings.
//
// The two rules that outrank everything here: NEVER silent coexistence and
// NEVER silent replacement. Structurally, that means every adoption attempt —
// success, failure, or refusal — produces an `AdoptionRecord` (TRIPWIRE
// adoption-never-silent), and no process is ever stopped outside an explicit
// user action in this flow.
//
// Slice C (#421) owns the lifecycle mechanics; this file owns the offer, the
// consent, the remembered choice, and the rollback's restore steps. As in
// slice C, everything side-effectful sits behind a protocol so tests never
// touch :8317, never read a real management key, and never stop a process.
